# Keystroke Injection Detection Tool
## James Palmer - April 2025

This program is designed to detect keystroke injection. The detection analyzes
both words per minute (WPM) and keypress duration to distinguish between human
and inhuman keyboard input. If input is detected that is likely to be from
keystroke injection, all keyboard input will be ignored for a preset amount of
time.
